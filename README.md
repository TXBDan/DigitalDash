# DigitalDash

This is a prototype digital dashboard for use in motorsports. I made it in 2015 and successfully ran it in my track car for a couple years. I'm now archiving the project here.

It features:
* LPC4088 microcontroller
* Many-LED RGB sequential shift light
* 20x4 character LCD display
* 2 LEDs (power/status and alarm)
* 3 push buttons (change screen, select, option)
* 4 analog inputs (water temp, oil temp, oil pressure, throttle position)
* 2 speed/pulse inputs (speed and tach)
* 10Hz GPS (position and elevation)
* 3-axis accelerometer
* SDcard logging
